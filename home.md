# K2HASH Node.js
K2HASH Node.js is an addon library that implemented [K2HASH](https://k2hash.antpick.ax/) of NoSQL Key Value Store(KVS) library published by Yahoo! JAPAN as open source so that it can be used on server side JavaScript environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## The purpose
We aim to make the high function of [K2HASH](https://k2hash.antpick.ax/) library adaptable to various development languages and environments, and to be able to use it with multiple platforms.
One way to do this is to provide a server side JavaScript environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) addon library.
This allows you to operate data(files and data in memory) handled by [K2HASH](https://k2hash.antpick.ax/) from both C/C++ language and Javascript.
